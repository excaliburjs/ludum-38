     * A [[Loader]] that pauses after loading to allow user

     * to play after loading (Apple Safari requires user
     * interaction to allow sounds, even for games)
     *
     * **Note:** Because Loader is not part of a Scene, you must
     * call `update` and `draw` manually on "child" objects.
     *
     * ## Implementing a Trigger
     *
     * The `PauseAfterLoader` requires an element to act as the trigger button
     * to start the game.
     *
     * For example, let's create an `<a>` tag to be our trigger and call it `tap-to-play`.
     *
     * ```html
     * <div id="wrapper">
     *    <canvas id="game"></canvas>
     *    <a id="tap-to-play" href='javascript:void(0);'>Tap to Play</a>
     * </div>
     * ```
     *
     * We've put it inside a wrapper to position it properly over the game canvas.
     *
     * Now let's add some CSS to style it (insert into `<head>`):
     *
     * ```html
     * <style>
     *     #wrapper {
     *         position: relative;
     *         width: 500px;
     *         height: 500px;
     *     }
     *     #tap-to-play {
     *         display: none;
     *         font-size: 24px;
     *         font-family: sans-serif;
     *         text-align: center;
     *         border: 3px solid white;
     *         position: absolute;
     *         color: white;
     *         width: 200px;
     *         height: 50px;
     *         line-height: 50px;
     *         text-decoration: none;
     *         left: 147px;
     *         top: 80%;
     *     }
     * </style>
     * ```
     *
     * Now we can create a `PauseAfterLoader` with a reference to our trigger button:
     *
     * ```ts
     * var loader = new ex.PauseAfterLoader('tap-to-play', [...]);
     * ```
     *
     * ## Use PauseAfterLoader for iOS
     *
     * The primary use case for pausing before starting the game is to
     * pass Apple's requirement of user interaction. The Web Audio context
     * in Safari is disabled by default until user interaction.
     *
     * Therefore, you can use this snippet to only use PauseAfterLoader when
     * iOS is detected (see [this thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9038625/detect-if-device-is-ios)
     * for more techniques).
     *
     * ```ts
     * var iOS = /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent) && !(<any>window).MSStream;
     * var loader: ex.Loader = iOS ? new ex.PauseAfterLoader('tap-to-play') : new ex.Loader();
     *
     * loader.addResource(...);
     * ```
